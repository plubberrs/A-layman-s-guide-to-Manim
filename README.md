# A-layman-s-guide-to-Manim

So my high school class is encouraged to use Python learning Math, and my classmates are all very scared of programming for some strange reason. I create this guide on Manim, a Python-based engine for explanatory Math developed by [3B1B and the community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim), for them primarily and for future generations at my high school.
